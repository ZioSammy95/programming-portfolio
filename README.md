🌍 Based in: The Hague, Netherlands (from August 2025)


I'm a self-taught developer from Italy with a strong interest in programming and software development.

This portfolio contains exercises and small projects I've built while studying the following languages and technologies:

- C / C++ / C#
- Java
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript

I'm planning to move to the Netherlands (The Hague) in August 2025 to look for my first job in the tech industry.  
I'm especially interested in backend development and open to any entry-level opportunity where I can grow and contribute.

Thanks for visiting!
