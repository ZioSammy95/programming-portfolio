# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Samuele Virgillito

I'm a self-taught developer from Italy passionate about software development and eager to grow professionally.

This programming portfolio contains projects and exercises I've built while learning and practicing these languages and technologies:

- C / C++ / C#
- Java
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript

I'm planning to move to The Hague, Netherlands, in August 2025 to pursue my first job in the tech industry.  
I'm especially interested in backend development and open to any entry-level opportunities where I can contribute and learn.

Thanks for visiting!
